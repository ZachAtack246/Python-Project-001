Immortal Omnissiah, hear our prayers

We are your children, pious scholars of the Path of the Machine

We prize knowledge above all else, for it is your eternal gift upon mankind

We aspire to the blessed form of the machine, and ascension through technology, that we might emulate your glory

Sheltered by steel, and protected by your avatars of war, we ply the stars in search of your lost gifts to our kind

Machine God, watch over us in our travels, shield us with metal and lightning. For the universe is an uncaring void, and the Warp hungers for us all.

Litany of Troubleshooting 

We check the power cord, for from the Omnissiah we draw strength and wisdom!

We confirm that the blessed power switch is in the on position, for only when our minds are opened do we receive Your gifts!

We reboot the sacred cogitator, for Thy wisdom demands we rededicate ourselves to the guidance of the Omnissiah!

We bow our heads, striking our foreheads with our palms, for we are unworthy of your divine wisdom!

We clear the cache, for true sight demands an unhindered mind!

We enter the terminal input modes and perform the rites of reconfiguration upon the wayward Graphical Data Manager, for your servants must be returned to the path!

We strike our foreheads once more, for thy rebuke is stern!

We reset the Administrator Authority, for the authority has been given unto us through divine will!

We curse the Adept who made this machine, for the Omnissiah abhors incompetence!

We boot in safe mode, for we are safe in thy mechanical embrace!

We configure a new boot disk, for through the revelations of the Omnissiah are we guided to perfection!

We reboot the system once more, for we must allow thy revelations to work in our minds!

We re-install the sacred operating system, for thy revelations can only improve upon the imperfect machine!

We undertake the rituals of compilation, pacing about and muttering swear words of devotion, burning sacred tobacco incense, breathing in its relaxing fume, for thy works are many and take some time to complete!

We offer our minds in prayer as we boot up the cogitator, for clearly the cogitator needs divine intervention for its continued proper function!

At long last, we offer praises unto thee upon the completion of the rites of troubleshooting, singing “Omnissiah-dammit, that took for-fucking-ever!”

Immortal Machine God, thank you for your protection.

From error of memory

From flawed calculation

From lost thoughts

From brilliance forgotten

From absent motivation

and from all the failings of mortal flesh and mind.

Ave Omnissiah
--------------------------------------------------
I am one of many

I am insignificant

Yet still I am blessed by the Omnissiah

I have felt him see through my eyes

I have felt him fight with my hands

I have felt him march with my feet

The Omnissiah is in us all

Honor him in your actions

Praise him in your song

Serve him in your life

Ave Deus Mechanicus!
--------------------
Pull the lever, flip the switch

Let the Omnissiah flow through you

Push the button, turn the dial

May his will drive you to greatness

Close the circuit, speak authorization

May his wisdom elevate your mind

Let sacred fluids flow, and fuel burn

May his wrath lay your foes low

March in the Machine God’s name

Let none bar your path.
-----------------------
Skitarii 1
Recite the Confirmations of Hostilities, and stir us from our sleep.

Fill our weak flesh and sacred augmetics with the light of the Omnissiah’s Motive Force.

Arm us with the tried and tested weapons of the Destroyer, and may their use bring ordered death.

Fill our minds with sacred code and the algebraic perfection of the Machine God’s song.

Send us to war under the banner of logic, our superiority unquestionable, our victory assured.

With steel and thunder, laser and venerated engine, our legion brings order.

We are the hand of the Omnissiah, upon this galaxy we impose his domain.

Ave Deus Mechanicus!

Litany of Praise

Sing the song of the Machine God.

Let the merciless logic of the Machine God invest thee.

None may stay our march.

None may stay our march.

***Machine God, ruler of all existence, I call you into this place.***

***In blessed incense and noospheric aura, may your glory surround us***

***May no daemon walk upon this ground. May mankind find refuge within these walls.*** 

***Protect us, your faithful, from constructs foul and untrue. May the light of circuit and forge burn away all shadow.***

***In your name I cast back ignorance. In your name I purge corruption. In your name I vanquish evil.***

***May your mastery of the universe be made manifest here. May your Grand Design be enforced upon this place. May the incursions of Chaos be halted.***

***May the horror before me be exorcised for all time!***

***In the name of the Machine God, and Omnissiah yet to come, I banish you to the Warp from whence you came!***
